Bind the mutation adapter to supported source syntax and the actual language toolchain. Parser and compiler errors are explicit gaps rather than successful mutation results.

Owned scope: `mutation.language-adapter`.

Offer: Bind the mutation adapter to supported source syntax and the actual language toolchain. Parser and compiler errors are explicit gaps rather than successful mutation results.

Input: `rig-services/testing.mutation.language-adapter.json`. Detection records the path even when its contents are malformed.

Coverage ceiling: language adapter configuration validation only; declared policy does not prove running language adapter behavior. Select an approved repository-owned command to verify that behavior.

minimal: source extensions — [".js"].

mid: compiler command — ["node","--check"].

maximal: parse errors are success — false.
