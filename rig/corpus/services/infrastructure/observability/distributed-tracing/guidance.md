# distributed tracing

Propagate trace context across HTTP and asynchronous boundaries and bound sampling costs. Sensitive request bodies must not become trace attributes.

Owned scope: `observability.distributed-tracing`.

Offer: Propagate trace context across HTTP and asynchronous boundaries and bound sampling costs. Sensitive request bodies must not become trace attributes.

Input: `rig-services/infrastructure.observability.distributed-tracing.json`. Detection records the path even when its contents are malformed.

Coverage ceiling: distributed tracing configuration validation only; declared policy does not prove running distributed tracing behavior. Select an approved repository-owned command to verify that behavior.

minimal: trace propagation — ["http","queue"].

mid: sampling policy — "bounded-head-sampling".

maximal: record sensitive payloads — false.
