# capacity load

Evaluate capacity under a declared workload and latency objective. Bound the experiment duration and stop conditions before putting pressure on an environment.

Owned scope: `scaling-reliability.capacity-load`.

Offer: Evaluate capacity under a declared workload and latency objective. Bound the experiment duration and stop conditions before putting pressure on an environment.

Input: `rig-services/infrastructure.scaling-reliability.capacity-load.json`. Detection records the path even when its contents are malformed.

Coverage ceiling: capacity load configuration validation only; declared policy does not prove running capacity load behavior. Select an approved repository-owned command to verify that behavior.

minimal: load workload — "100 concurrent requests".

mid: slo latency ms — 250.

maximal: unbounded load duration — false.
