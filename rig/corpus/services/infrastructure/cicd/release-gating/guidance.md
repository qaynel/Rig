# release gating

Bind release gates to the revision and artifact that will ship. Earlier green results do not authorize a different commit or rebuilt artifact.

Owned scope: `cicd.release-gating`.

Offer: Bind release gates to the revision and artifact that will ship. Earlier green results do not authorize a different commit or rebuilt artifact.

Input: `rig-services/infrastructure.cicd.release-gating.json`. Detection records the path even when its contents are malformed.

Coverage ceiling: release gating configuration validation only; declared policy does not prove running release gating behavior. Select an approved repository-owned command to verify that behavior.

minimal: required gates — ["tests","artifact digest"].

mid: release revision — "a1b2c3d".

maximal: use stale gate results — false.
