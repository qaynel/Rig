Select a deployment strategy with measurable rollout and rollback conditions. Configuration validates the declared controls; live canary outcomes need separately available deployment tooling.

Owned scope: `cicd.deployment-strategy`.

Offer: Select a deployment strategy with measurable rollout and rollback conditions. Configuration validates the declared controls; live canary outcomes need separately available deployment tooling.

Input: `rig-services/infrastructure.cicd.deployment-strategy.json`. Detection records the path even when its contents are malformed.

Coverage ceiling: deployment strategy configuration validation only; declared policy does not prove running deployment strategy behavior. Select an approved repository-owned command to verify that behavior.

minimal: strategy — "canary".

mid: rollback trigger — "error rate above budget".

maximal: automatic full rollout without checks — false.
