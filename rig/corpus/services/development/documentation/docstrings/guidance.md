# docstrings

Document the externally visible parameters and failure behavior of public symbols. A reader must be able to use the function without reconstructing its implementation.

Owned scope: `documentation.docstrings`.

Offer: Document the externally visible parameters and failure behavior of public symbols. A reader must be able to use the function without reconstructing its implementation.

Input: `rig-services/development.documentation.docstrings.json`. Detection records the path even when its contents are malformed.

Coverage ceiling: docstrings configuration validation only; declared policy does not prove running docstrings behavior. Select an approved repository-owned command to verify that behavior.

minimal: documented symbols — ["parseRecord"].

mid: parameters — ["raw: serialized record"].

maximal: failure contract — "throws on malformed records".
